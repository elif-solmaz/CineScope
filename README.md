## 🏗️ State Management - Redux  

CineScope uses **Redux Toolkit** for state management.  

- **\`moviesSlice.ts\`** → Manages the movie list and API calls.
-  **\`moviesDetailSlice.ts\`** → Manages the movie details.  
- **\`store.ts\`** → Combines all reducers and provides a global state to the app.  

To inspect the Redux state, use [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd).
